				AUDIO PROCESSING
Acoustic Properties Measured
The following acoustic properties of each voice are measured:
1.duration
2.Mean frequency
3.sd
4.median
5.Q25
6.Q75
7.IQR
8.skew
9.kurt
10.sp.ent
11.sfm
12.mode
13.centroid
14.peakf
15.meanfun
16.minfun
17.maxfun
18.meandom
19.mindom
20.maxdom
21.dfrange
22.modindx
These paraameters are extracted from the audio signal, in order to perform further
analysis.
Language used:
In order to implement the algorithm, we write a code in R, which is later translated
into python.
Packages Used in R:
Seewave
Soundgen
tuner
warbleR
The output from the pre-processed WAV files were saved into a CSV file,
containing 3168 row and 21 columns (20 columns for each feature and one label
column for the classification of male or female).




                      Database
The audio signal is stored in CSV format.
The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and
female speakers. Each voice sample is stored as a .WAV file, which is then pre-
processed for acoustic analysis using the specan function from the WarbleR R
package. Specan measures 22 acoustic parameters on acoustic signals for which
the start and end times are provided. The voice samples are processed by acoustic
analysis in with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz containing 3168 rows
and 21 columns (20 columns for each feature and one label column for the
classification of male or female)
